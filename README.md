NavDrawerActionbarComp
======================
Sample app which can create events locally and optionally add to calendar.

Wanted to use Navigation drawer http://developer.android.com/design/patterns/navigation-drawer.html
and ActionbarCompat http://developer.android.com/reference/android/support/v7/app/ActionBarActivity.html with custom styles 
for SDK 2.3.3 and above.

Also used Loaders framework http://developer.android.com/guide/components/loaders.html with support libray v4
